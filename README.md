### Hi there, I'm Dimitris ðŸ‘‹

I call myself a Software Engineer and a Maker. During the days I like to hack on embedded systems of all shapes and sizes.
Having worked on systems running [Yocto Linux](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) and the Android Open Source Project ([AOSP](https://source.android.com/))
I am very passionate about **software architecture and clean code** being the enablers for high quality, reusability, and maintainability.
Consequently, I incorporate this mindset and principles into my way of working as I believe they are fundamental for **agility and effectiveness**.

Usually, I spend my evenings on open source projects which I [blog](https://platis.solutions/blog/) about.
My favorite ones revolve around IoT, robotics and handheld gadgets where I love to develop the entire product stack.
Hardware-wise, this includes everything from the PCB to the physical case around the electronics and software, from the embedded firmware to the cloud.
Lately, I have also gotten into creating [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/PlatisSolutionsOpenSource) tutorials about software craftsmanship with C++ and embedded systems.

Additionally, I taught some courses at the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers, in Gothenburg Sweden.
My main course was the undergraduate [DIT112/DIT113](https://canvas.gu.se/courses/30372/assignments/syllabus) course on Systems Development at the University of Gothenburg.
In DIT112, students learn how to create a system composed of both software and hardware components in regards to development, requirements handling, testing and quality assurance; all that, in an agile manner. Check out some of their projects: [[2019](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxwAhdZUbSph38__jMbrT-IjU4i3ZnMap)], [[2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxwAhdZUbSpjCxWXejYPHFcKxBt-43dUq)], [[2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5SjewAVq1w&list=PLxwAhdZUbSph5BRXXh0Mt37lpD-ZY5uzx&index=1)], [[2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snG1YhIBNhA&list=PLxwAhdZUbSpgVqUwkZQCy-oRINtBnYTZy)].
During the autumn term of 2021, I also taught the postgraduate [DAT265](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/15341/assignments/syllabus) course on Software Evolution at Chalmers. The students were taught how to evolve an existing code base by using various techniques to comprehend and refactor it while being in touch with the upstream project's stakeholders.

Lastly, I provide private training courses on C++ for professionals. The courses are tailored to the needs of the participants and can be held on-site or online. Recurring customers include large automakers, automotive suppliers, consulting companies, and defense equipment manufacturers.
The courses are focused on modern C++ and the examples are inspired by real-world projects, mostly from the embedded systems domain. The participants are engaged in multiple hands-on exercises with a lab session every hour. The labs are designed to be challenging, help the participants understand the theory better, and provide material for further study in their own time.
