### Hi there, I'm Dimitris ðŸ‘‹

I call myself a Software Engineer and a Maker. During the days I like to hack on embedded systems of all shapes and sizes.
Having worked on systems running [Yocto Linux](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) and the Android Open Source Project ([AOSP](https://source.android.com/))
I am very passionate about **software architecture and clean code** being the enablers for high quality, reusability, andmaintainability.
Consequently, I incorporate this mindset and principles into my way of working as I believe they are fundamental for **agility and effectiveness**.

Usually, I spend my evenings on open source projects which I [blog](https://platis.solutions/blog/) about.
My favorite ones revolve around IoT, robotics and handheld gadgets where I love to develop the entire product stack.
Hardware-wise, this includes everything from the PCB to the physical case around the electronics and software, from the embedded firmware to the cloud.

Additionally, I teach the [DIT112](https://canvas.gu.se/courses/30372/assignments/syllabus) course on Systems Development at the University of Gothenburg.
In DIT112, students learn how to create a system composed of both software and hardware components in regards to development, requirements handling, testing and quality assurance; all that, in an agile manner. Check out some of their projects.
